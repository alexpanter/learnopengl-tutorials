    <h1>Terrain Rendering Series</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to the Terrain Rendering Series, a series in which we explore common
      techniques for rendering terrains with OpenGL. As this is the first article
      in the series, we will start with the most basic stuff, and later on explore
      more advanced topics.
    </p>

    <p>
      This series is not intended for the beginning OpenGL programmer, as reading it
      requires you to be familiar with several concepts.
      Fortunately, all these concepts are very well explained in earlier tutorials,
      so if your OpenGL is a bit rusty, you may want to take a quick look at them
      and then come back here.
      We build upon the following OpenGL concepts and will not provide any
      introduction (otherwise this article would be painfully long to read):<br>
      <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Shaders">Shaders</a>,
      <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Transformations">Transformations</a>
      <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Camera">Camera</a>,
      <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Basic-Lighting">Basic Lighting</a>,
      <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Depth-testing">Depth Testing</a>,
      <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Blending">Blending</a>,
      <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Face-culling">Face Culling</a>,
      <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Cubemaps">Cubemaps</a>,
      <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Geometry-Shader">Geometry Shaders</a>,
    </p>

    <p>
      Although not a strict requirement, it is recommended that you are familiar with
      indexed drawing (using <code>glDrawElements</code>). The techniques taught in
      this tutorial series can also extended with deferred rendering for greater
      artistical freedom and control, but that is a somewhat relaxed requirement:
      Implementing deferred rendering, though recommended, will not be a part of this
      tutorial series.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you follow the code snippets in this tutorial, it is <strong>required</strong>
      that you set your compiler version to at least C++11. And C++17 is recommended.
      For Unix/Linux/FreeBSD/MacOS operating systems, the compiler flag <code>
        -std=c++17</code> will usually accomplish this, though it depends on your
      choice of compiler. For CMake, insert something like the following in your
      <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file:<br><br>
      <code>target_compile_features(<project_name> PUBLIC cxx_std_17)</code><br><br>

      For Windows, you are probably using Visual Studio. The you may find help here:
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/working-with-project-properties?view=vs-2019">Set compiler and build properties</a>,

    <h2>The Height Map</h2>

    <p>
      The most common technique for rendering 3D terrain is by using what is called
      a <strong>height map</strong> (sometimes referred to as a height field).
      In this technique we define a grid of points, where each point is attributed a
      height value. If we position this grid horizontally in our 3d world, and
      create a vertex position for each grid point by using its height value, we can
      render a 3D terrain. An example of this technique in use can be seen below:
    </p>

    <div class="img-row">
      <div class="two-img-column">
        <img src="img/terrain.png" alt="Snow" style="width:100%">
      </div>
      <div class="two-img-column">
        <img src="img/terrain-wireframe.png" alt="Forest" style="width:100%">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      In the images above we actually have 2 height maps, one for the terrain and one
      for the water surface. The terrain is generated using a seeded noise function,
      and the water surface is rendered with sine waves layered on top of each other.
      Both concepts will be explored in later tutorials.<br>
      The image to the right shows the same scene rendered in fireframed mode.
    </p>


    <h2>Explaining the Concept in Math</h2>

    <p>
      Math is a wonderful tool for explaining topics in short and concise ways, and
      we make no exception here. No advanced math is required to follow this tutorial,
      and I do my best to explain stuff along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
      We define our height map as a set of grid points, uniformly distributed in a
      discrete integer grid. This sounds way worse than it is - it simply means that
      all grid points have the same distance to each other, and that each grid point
      has coordinates <i>(x, y)</i>, where both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are integers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Say that we want a height map of size <i>M * N</i>? (<i>M</i> and <i>N</i>
      do not need to be equal). So we make a drawing a bit like the
      following:
    </p>

    <div class="img-row">
      <img src="img/grid-points-axes.png" alt="Snow" style="width:30%">
    </div><br>

    The number of grid points is obviously <i>M * N</i>, but that information in
    itself isn't very useful. Remember that OpenGL is a specification for hardware
    rasterization, and that we have certain restrictions? One of these restrictions
    is that the <u>only</u> way to render a surface with OpenGL is by providing a set
    of triangles in a vertex buffer object (ie. an array).

    <p>
      Thus, our first task is to convert the image above into a triangle mesh.
      This is illustrated below:
    </p>

    <img src="img/terrain-mesh-triangles.png" alt="Terrain mesh triangulation"
         style="width: 450px; border: none;">

    <p>
      So let's specify some metrics: Let <i>T</i> be the number of triangles in the
      triangle mesh, and let <i>I</i> be the number of indices to send to an OpenGL
      element buffer object (EBO) (remember indexed rendering?). We then compute
      these variables:
    </p>

    \[T = (M – 1) \cdot (N – 1) \cdot 2\]
    \[I = T \cdot 3\]

    <p>
      The programmatic recipe will then be as following:
      <ol>
        <li>Iterate through each square which contains two triangles
          (e.g. the square formed by the upper-left corner, and its 3 surrounding
          grid points). We make this a double for-loop with loops running up to
          <code>M-1</code> and <code>N-1</code>.
        </li>
        <li>For each loop iteration, calculate the coordinates for the 4 grid
          points that form the current square. Then, insert 3 grid points for the
          upper-left triangle, and for the lower-right triangle, into a list.</li>
        <li>After the loop, buffer this list into an OpenGL EBO, and also buffer
        the grid points into an OpenGL VBO.</li>
        <li>Done.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      By using an EBO, we can minimize the GPU memory usage, which is useful when
      we want to have really big height maps.
    </p>



    <h2>Data Structure for a Height Map</h2>

    <p>
      To represent a height map in code, this tutorial uses a flat 1-dimensional array
      where each index contains a custom object appropriate for modelling a landscape.
      This representation is shown below.
    </p>

    <pre class="hljs"><code>
  enum class TerrainType {
      Grass,
      Water
  };

  class HeightMapEntry
  {
  public:
      Glfloat Height;
      TerrainType Terrain;
  };

  const int N = 8;
  const int M = 8;
  const int SIZE = N * M;
  HeightMapEntry heightMap[SIZE];
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      Here we specify the data type for each grid point in the height map.
      By providing more information than simply a height value, we introduce a lot
      of flexibility in our program.
    </p>

    <p>
      We could also define the height map as an array of floats, but by using a
      custom object as we do here, we can associate to our height map any set of
      values that we might want. Here is some inspiration for your curiosity:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>We could attach different terrain types throughout our height map,
        and blend different terrain textures together based on this parameter.</li>
      <li>Imagine having a function which analyses the height map and creates
        biome information, such as where to place trees.</li>
      <li>If we decide to model a landscape which contains a river, we could use the
        height map to determine the direction of the water's movement through the
        river, based on its connection to the surrounding ocean.</li>
      <li>If we create a 3D game with units moving around, we can use the height
        map to calculate the movement speed of each unit, taking into account the
        slope of the surrounding terrain (by comparing different height values).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Technical</h2>

    <p>
      Now that we have the data structure for a height map, we need to create some
      triangles and send them to the GPU. By using indexed rendering, we save a lot
      of GPU memory. Following the programmatic recipe explained in the math
      section, the code for generating the triangle indices looks as following:
    </p>

    <pre class="hljs"><code>
  std::vector&lt;glm::vec3&gt; vertices;
  vertices.reserve(N * M);
  for (int y = 0; y < M; y++) {
      for (int x = 0; x < N; x++) {
          GLuint index = y*N + x;
          vertices.push_back(glm::vec3(x, y, heightMap[index].Height));
      }
  }
  GLuint T = (N-1) * (M-1) * 2;
  GLuint I = T * 3;

  std::vector&lt;GLuint&gt; indices;
  indices.reserve(I);
  for (int y = 0; y < M-1; y++) {
      for (int x = 0; x < N-1; x++) {
          // upper-left triangle
          GLuint topLeft = y*N + x;
          indices.push_back(topLeft);
          indices.push_back(topLeft + 1);
          indices.push_back(topLeft + M);
          // lower-right triangle
          indices.push_back(topLeft + 1);
          indices.push_back(topLeft + 1 + M);
          indices.push_back(topLeft + M);
      }
  }
                          </code></pre>

    <p>
      Here we create a buffer (<code>std::vector&lt;glm::vec3&gt;</code>) of 3d
      points by using the height values of our height map array.
      By using a nested for-loop, we can simply pass the values for <i>x</i>
      and <i>y</i> as is.
    </p>

    <p>
      After this, we create a buffer for the indices and iterate in a similar
      fashion. We now have the triangle indices, in correct order, for our mesh.
      The only thing remaining is to set the attribute pointers, and send them
      to the GPU:
    </p>

    <pre class="hljs"><code>
  GLuint VAO, VBO, EBO;
  glGenVertexArrays(1, &VAO);
  glGenBuffers(1, &VBO);
  glGenBuffers(1, &EBO);

  glBindVertexArray(VAO);
  glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, VBO);
  glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices) * N * M,
               vertices.data(), GL_STATIC_DRAW);

  glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, EBO);
  glBufferData(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(GLuint) * I,
               indices.data(), GL_STATIC_DRAW);

  // attribute pointer - vertex position
  glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, sizeof(glm::vec3),
                        (GLvoid*)0);
  glEnableVertexAttribArray(0);

  glBindVertexArray(0);
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      And when we wish to render the surface mesh:
    </p>

    <pre class="hljs"><code>
  glBindVertexArray(VAO);
  glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, I, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, 0);
  glBindVertexArray(0);
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Camera Model</h2>

    <p>
      Different camera models exist, but for this tutorial series we use a bird
      perspective camera, as seen in real-time strategy games. This is suitable
      for an overview of the terrain, as it provides methods for hovering across
      the landscape. But depending on your application (e.g. first-person shooter
      game), you might want to adapt to a different camera model (see the
      <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Camera">camera</a>
      tutorial).
    </p>

    <p>
      For this camera model we define a camera class with the following interface:
    </p>

    <pre class="hljs"><code>
  class BasicRTSCamera
  {
  public:
      // methods for camera movement
      void MoveNorth(GLfloat cameraSpeed);
      void MoveSouth(GLfloat cameraSpeed);
      void MoveWest(GLfloat cameraSpeed);
      void MoveEast(GLfloat cameraSpeed);
      void MoveUp(GLfloat cameraSpeed);
      void MoveDown(GLfloat cameraSpeed);
      void RotateLeft(GLfloat cameraSpeed);
      void RotateRight(GLfloat cameraSpeed);

      // methods for rendering the scene
      void CalculateViewProjection();
      const glm::mat4* GetViewMatrix() const;
      const glm::mat4* GetProjectionMatrix() const;
  };
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      These methods move that camera across the surface of the height map,
      up and down along the vertical axis (in this tutorial, we use <i>z</i> to
      indicate terrain height), and a rotation fixed around the camera's viewing
      direction. This camera model disallows any <i>roll</i> around the camera's
      viewing angle (remember <i>pitch</i>, <i>yaw</i>, and <i>roll</i>?).
    </p>

    <p>
      The definition of these methods can be found in the
      <a href="">source code</a>
      for this tutorial (omitted here for brevity). Creating a camera class is
      highly recommended.
    </p>



    <h2>Setting up "the rest"</h2>

    <p>
      "The rest" is a broad term, but here it refers to creating a GLFW window,
      compiling shaders, configuring your build (I use GNU Makefile), linking to
      the external libraries, capturing input events, and measuring program time
      to balance out the camera's movement speed.
      <br><br>

      All these topics have been covered in sufficient depth in earlier tutorials,
      so if you are unsure about how to proceed you may want to take a look at them
      again, or simply check out the
      <a href="">source code</a>
      for this tutorial.
    </p>

    <p>
      The result should look like the following:
    </p>

    <div class="img-row">
      <div class="two-img-column">
        <img src="img/heightmap-initial-rendering.png" alt="Snow" style="width:100%">
      </div>
      <div class="two-img-column">
        <img src="img/heightmap-initial-rendering-wireframe.png" alt="Forest" style="width:100%">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      If your result does not resemble the images above or you experience a completely
      black screen, you can compare your code with the application's
      <a href="">source code</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the next tutorial we will focus on making the landscape look more like a real
      landscape.
    </p>


    <h2>Optimizations</h2>

    <p>
      You may want to (ie. you are <strong>strongly</strong> encouraged to) enable
      face culling when rendering large landscape meshes, since there is no need to
      render each triangle in the mesh from both sides. Fortunately, it is a quick
      setup:
    </p>

    <pre class="hljs"><code>
  // back-face culling
  glFrontFace(GL_CCW); // triangle vertices are read counter clock-wise
  glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE);
  glCullFace(GL_BACK);
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      Just make sure that the rest of your scene also 'faces' the right way :).
    </p>
